# Netflix_DataAnalysis
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of a Netflix dataset, applying a range of techniques to derive meaningful insights. I began by ensuring data integrity through the identification and removal of duplicate records using the `drop_duplicates()` function. I then addressed missing values by visualizing them with a heatmap and the `isnull()` method. To visualize the data effectively, I utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn, creating line graphs, bar graphs, and heatmaps, and explored the `countplot()` function in Seaborn. Key visualization functions such as `grid()`, `legend()`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `title` were used to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of these visualizations and for easy readiness and understanding the visualization in human understandable format in easy way. Additionally, I learned to use the `figure` function to customize plot sizes and layouts , also explored more about groupby( ) function

The analysis focused on several key tasks, including identifying the Show ID and Director for 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,' determining the year with the highest number of releases, and counting the total number of movies and TV shows. I filtered the data to locate movies released in 2000, TV shows released in India, and the top 10 directors contributing the most content to Netflix. Also Learned about `value_counts()` and `unique()` function for finding unique ratings and unique categories in netflix and also learned about how to count the unique values , how to count each data that is repeated.

Furthermore, I identified the country with the most TV shows and sorted the dataset by release year using the `sort_values()` function. This enabled a comprehensive analysis of trends and content distribution over time. I also explored the `to_datetime()` function in pandas and how to extract year from Date Column , and working on that year particularly

Overall, this project expanded my knowledge of data analysis and visualization techniques, providing a deeper understanding of Netflixâ€™s content library and distribution patterns. The skills acquired, including advanced visualization techniques and data summarization methods, have significantly enhanced my ability to present data-driven insights effectively.
